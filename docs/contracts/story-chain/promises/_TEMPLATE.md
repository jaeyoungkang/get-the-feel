## 1. Promise

So that ...

## 2. Intent Check

### intent-check:{semantic-slug}

- question: {user-intent question}
- evidence: {runtime-output or rendered-dom ref, or unknown until measured}
- why live judge: {why this cannot be reduced to one deterministic Acceptance Check}
- linked acceptance checks:
  - acceptance-check:{semantic-slug}
- answer criteria: {what shallow or misleading answer must fail}

## 3. Acceptance Check

### acceptance-check:{semantic-slug}

- description: {single deterministic contract}
- evidence: {vitest, run:shell, guard, or unknown until propagated}

## 4. Evidence

Verdict starts as `unknown`. Flip to `met` only with production-equivalent evidence:

```yaml
evidence:
  kind: runtime-output | rendered-dom
  ref: <path or artifact ref>
```

If the Intent Check is absorbed into Acceptance Checks, cite the Human Judgment Gate decision in the covering Evidence Ledger and `docs/intent-judgments.md`.
